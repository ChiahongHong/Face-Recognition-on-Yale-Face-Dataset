# Face-Recognition-on-Yale-Face-Dataset
I used Extend Yale Face Database to explore face recognition under 1 pose & 64 illuminations.
The techniques that I implemented include PCA, KNN, SVM, and Convolution Neural Network (CNN). 

Finally, recommendation after comparing the three algorithms regarding the test accuracy, and give the recommendation.
